# The Return of the Cave Story Modding Wiki?

IDK maybe I guess. This is trial run #1: using the **git-wiki-theme** project. You can see more details with the original readme found on the [skeleton ðŸ’€](skeleton) page. This page will be here as an example of the syntax for wiki pages, but the actual info there really only pertains to Enlight and Brayconn.

This wiki uses GitHub accounts, so make sure to login to that. If you have admin/maintainer privileges for the GitHub repository the edits will be instant. Otherwise they should make something called a "pull request" that can be approved by the admins.

Discussion of this project is primarily found on the [CSMC Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xRsWpz6). If this doesn't work out then Enlight can try other solutions. Also if we determine to stick with this then of course this homepage here will also get changed to something more serious.

## Helpful Links:

Oh my gosh it's 3 links with which you can click on:

- [CSMC Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xRsWpz6): The Discord Server for the Cave Story Modding Community. It was mentioned earlier. They mod Undertale there.

- [Editors](cave-story-editors): Editors for modifying **The Most Excellent Game Cave Story**.

- [The Example Page](example-page): Which does exist. *For now.*

- [cavestory.org](https://cavestory.org): If you haven't played **Cave Story** yet, you are probably lost on the internet. I would recommend that you acquire a map or follow a quest marker to make your way to the destination you are trying to reach.

As mentioned earlier, this homepage will be more serious eventually.

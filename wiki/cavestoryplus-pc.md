# Cave Story+ (PC)

**Cave Story+ (PC)** refers to the PC release of Cave Story+ by **Nicalis**, released in 2011 and distributed primarily on Steam and Epic Games. Do *not* touch the GoG version or your computer will explode.

While it *can* be used for modding, its scope is extremely limited in terms of engine limits, documentation and distribution - the few mods that have made with it are typically challenge stages.

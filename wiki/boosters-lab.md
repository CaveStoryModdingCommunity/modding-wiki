 > *"I'm pretty sure that, with this ... release [4.2.0], Booster's Lab is the definitive Cave Story editor now.
    There's really no reason to use any other editor for modding."* - GirakaCHEEZER
    

**Booster's Lab** is a Java-based cross-platform Cave Story editor created by **Noxid**. Currently, it is the most recommended editor due to its stability, range of features and multi-engine compatibility.

 *"I'm pretty sure that, with this ... release [4.2.0], Booster's Lab is the definitive Cave Story editor now.
    There's really no reason to use any other editor for modding."* - GirakaCHEEZER

## How to Use Booster's Lab

*Refer to the tutorial guides located in "help", then "oh god what do I do" for basic information on how to mod Cave Story using Booster's Lab. These guides also come with visuals to help you understand how things work.

Booster's Lab comes with a map list, entity list, a TSC scripting module, a map properties window, a Hex Patcher, a Hackinator module, and several more cosmetic options.

To edit a map, choose a map from the map list on the far left of the editor and double click it. This will bring up the map level where you can edit the tiles and apply entities. On the header of the level editor, there are four bullets that you can toggle by clicking them:

    Tile
    Entity
    Script
    Mapdata

"Tile" allows you to edit and design the level, and manipulate the tileset properties. Refer to the Tile article to learn more.

"Entity" allows you to place entities ranging from friendly characters/enemies to general tools that trigger events from the TSC script. To place entities in the map, highlight a spot on the map and press "i". You can also select all of the same entities by holding "shift" and clicking the entity.

"Script" toggles the map's TSC script in an external window. This window will allow you to add, remove, and edit current and new events to the current map data. Refer to the TSC article to learn more about the commands in the game and how to use them.

"Mapdata" toggles the map's properties. This will allow you to change the name of the map, edit the backgrounds and set the npc spritesheets for the map.


## Trivia

  - This editor has over 10,000 lines of code.
  - Sprites from Noxid's parody of Pixel's '100 Cats' appear in the various editor menus.
  - This is the most complete editor for Cave Story to date.
  - The icon is a modified version of Professor Booster's 'Facepic' Image; the modification consists of an additional mohawk.
  - Booster's Lab can run smoothly on Windows 2000.
  - This has support for "Cave Engine", a custom Cave Story engine remake created by Noxid with 2x resolution and other features. This engine is much more powerful than the original Cave Story engine.
  - The layout is very similar to Sue's Workshop in some menus, but only about halfway. This is likely intentional as Sue's Workshop was popular for its user-friendly interface.

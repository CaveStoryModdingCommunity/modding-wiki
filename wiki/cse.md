# Cave Story Engine

*This page is a stub! You can help by expanding it!*

**Cave Story Engine**, not to be confused with anything else, was a Cave Story engine being developed by **Noxid** for his genocide mod, *King: Strife and Sacrifice*. The engine was the first to support [layers-mode](layers-mode), and was designed as the perfect companion for [Booster's Lab](boosters-lab) (also made by **Noxid**).

# Autumn's Various Additions dll
AVA is a dll written by user **Autumn**[^1] that works with the [modloader](modloader) but takes an "everything but the kitchen sink" approach to DLL modding. Chances are, if you need to add some sort of hack or mod to the vanilla engine, it's in here.



[^1]: Side note: Autumn has made quite a few dll mods that add impressive features to vanilla Cave Story, such as [fmod music support](https://github.com/autumn-mnya/fmod-cave-story) and [ghost multiplayer](https://github.com/autumn-mnya/CS-Netplay-Dll-Server) [^2]
[^2]: Side-side note: this side note was **not** written by Autumn.

The current version's features are:
- Custom .pxt loading
- Custom entities
- Custom player physics
- New Tile types (like bounce pads, ice, etc.)
- Extra TSC Commands (like variables, sub-functions, etc.)
- Plaintext TSC (no encrpytion)
- HEX Patch Loader
- Wall jumping
- Double jumping/Extra jumping
- Pause menu editing
- Stage.tbl loading
- Collaboration Mode
- And many more features

A more detailed rundown on what each feature is and how to use it is present in the `settings.ini` bundled with the release build of the mod.

Many of the mods in this dll are a conglomeration of other dlls or source edits to CSE2, but since this is not a full engine decompilation, its source code is freely avalable to download.

To help make the new features easier to use, the dll comes with a tweaked version of [Booster's Lab](boosters-lab) that contains all the custom tiles, TSC syntax, etc.

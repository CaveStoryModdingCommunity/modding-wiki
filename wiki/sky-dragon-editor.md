**Sky Dragon Editor** is an in-progress editor written in python developed by **Jakzie**. It has been described by some to be "Cave Editor dark mode", though unlike CE, is still in active development with new QOL features being added regularly in response to the modern modding scene.

More info can be found on the program's [download page](https://jakzie.eu/cavestory/editor).

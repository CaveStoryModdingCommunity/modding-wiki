Geobox was an engine written in c++ being developed by **Fluffball**. 
While a public release was planned, and it was privately distributed to beta testers, an official release was never made and the developer is no longer active within the community.

The geobox engine is notable for its promise of a rich feature-set and beautiful raycast graphics, and is often used as a benchmark to compare the graphical features of other engines to.

Currently, the closest obtainable alternative to this engine is [doukutsu-rust](doukutsu-rs).

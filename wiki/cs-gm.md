**Cave Story GM** is an incomplete implementation of Cave Story done in Gamemaker Studio. It supports loading some classic assets from the freeware release as well as embedded assets as part of the engine itself.

In the words of its creator,
> The game isn't finished. From a new game it's only playable up to the end of the second main area. I'm sure there's a lot of issues I missed up to that point so keep that in mind if something looks off.

The engine also features some redrawn character assets as well as new weapons and features.


## Downloads
The downloads for the engine source and precompiled binary can be found on Google Drive, as linked in the forum thread.

The drive links can also be found here:

- [Resource folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zh8Hs8UIpcr4z2fAE3M_qiNGu3khWmqd)

The cumulative total of all the zipped assets amounts to roughly a gigabyte.

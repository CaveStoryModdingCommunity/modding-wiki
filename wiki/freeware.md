Cave Story '**Freeware**' refers to the original engine and release of Cave Story, created by **Daisuke 'Pixel' Amaya** and released December 20th, 2004.

As its source code is not available, Freeware is primarily modified with one of two options: the 86x Assembly programming language, commonly referred to in the community as ['ASM'/'ASM hacks'](assembly), or the dll tool [Modloader](modloader).

Many hacks already exist for Freeware. Chances are, if you want some feature, it's already been made into a convenient patch. Many of these patches can be applied with [Booster's lab](boosters-lab) or other [editors](cavestory-editors).
For more specifics, please see the [Advanced Freeware Hacking](advanced-freeware-hacking) page.

It is considered the most beginner-friendly engine, primarily due to extensive documentation as well as the large library of user-made hacks made over the years.

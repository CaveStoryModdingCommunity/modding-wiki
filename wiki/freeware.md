# Freeware


**Freeware** refers to the original engine and release of Cave Story, created by **Daisuke 'Pixel' Amaya** and released December 20th, 2004.

As its source code is not available, it is primarily modified with the 86x Assembly programming language, commonly referred to in the community as 'ASM' or 'ASM hacks'.

It is considered the most beginner-friendly engine, primarily due to extensive documentation as well as the large library of user-made hacks made over the years.

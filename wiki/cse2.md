# Cave Story Engine 2

**Cave Story Engine 2**, commonly referred to as **CSE2** is a fan-made decompilation of the original freeware Cave Story, made by a bunch of people and originally released on a certain date.

While Nicalis initially took it down with a DMCA, despite rumours otherwise they have not gone after mods based on it, and it still remains popular for usage.
However, publicly sharing the source code is not advised and strongly discouraged by the modding community.
Because of this, a download link will not be provided, but those seeking it may locate it with the help of their favourite search engine.

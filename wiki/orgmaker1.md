 ## Background
 Orgmaker 1 or Orgmaker V1.3.4 is a musical program created by Pixel sometime in 1999 as an improved version of his previous musical program, Piyo Piyo.
 It's main use is for creating and editing the Organya format, the music format used in Cave Story. It supports up to 16 Tracks with 8 being dedicated
 to Melody and the other 8 being dedicated to Drums.

 ## History
 Some time after the last [Archived Orgmaker](archivedorgmakers), Pixel released Orgmaker V1.3.4, this version would be where Pixel made all of Cave Story's
 soundtrack heard in game. It's not documented how but presumed someone eventually got their hands on Orgmaker V1.3.4 and proceeded to post it somwhere, it
 then spread and made it's way to the Cave Story Tribute Site.

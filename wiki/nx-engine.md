# NX-Engine

**NX-Engine** is a defunct open-source recreation of Cave Story's engine by **Caitlin Shaw** released in 2010. It was later picked up and further developed by **isage** into nxengine-evo, an improved version.

While it powered many of the older ports to other platforms and consoles, it is not recommended anymore for modding due to CSE2/D-RS essentially making it obsolete and also all the ISSUES.

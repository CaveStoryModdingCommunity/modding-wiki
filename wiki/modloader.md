# Modloader

___



The DLL modloader was developed by Clownacy and initially released in 2017. It supplements [Freeware](freeware) Cave Story by allowing the user to inject their own code into the executable at runtime.


It can best be described as a split between complete engine modding with something like [CSE2](cse2) or [d-rs](doukutsu-rs) and straight vanilla modding using an assembler and x86 instructions. Developers write their program in their preferred language (typically c/c++) and tell their code what address in the original EXE to inject the mod. The result provides high-level expandability to Freeware.
